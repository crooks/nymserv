Nymserv - A GnuPG-based pseudonymous email server

Nymserv is a Posix based GnuPG-based pseudonymous email server, written in
Python.  It functions as a bridge between standard and registered anonymous
email users.  Messages from anonymous users are delivered in plain-text via
SMTP.  Messages to anonymous users are encrypted using GnuPG and delivered to a
shared mailbox, in the form of a Usenet Newsgroups "alt.anonymous.messages".

This is beta software and may occasionally crash.  Please provide feedback,

future releases of the application.  Please see the CHANGES file for details of
