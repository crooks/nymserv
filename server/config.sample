# vim: syntax=cfg

# Sample Nymserver configuration file - 2011/09/21
#
# To use this file, rename it .nymservrc and place it in your homedir.
# The settings shown are the defaults unless otherwise stated.

[paths]
# The user folder is the most important element of the server (along with
# the GnuPG keyring). The user folder contains the Public Keys and
# configuration database for each Nym. Make sure it's backed up or your users
# may, one day, be very sad.
#user = /home/nymserv/users

# The pool is used to store messages waiting to be posted to Usenet.
#pool = /home/nymserv/pool

# As per tradition, the etc folder is the place where configuration details
# are stored.
#etc = /home/nymserv/etc

[logging]
# The fully-qualfied path and filename or where the nymserver should write its
# log. No auto-rotation is performed on this so you might want to use a
# logrotate process to take care of it.
#file = /crypt/home/nymserv/log/nym.log

# Level of logging.  Choose from error, warn, info, debug in increasing levels
# of verbosity.
#level = info


[pgp]
# The directory where GnuPG public and secret keyrings will be located. It's a
# good idea to make this different to the GnuPG default (~/.gnupg) as
# accidents do happen.
#keyring = /home/nymserv/keyring

# The passphrase for unlocking the Nymserver's secret key.  Sadly there's no
# option but to place it here in plain-text.  This option has no default and
# must be set before the Nymserver will work.
#passphrase = pgppassphrase

# This needs to be the Nymserver's public keyid.  If possible, set it to the
# complete fingerprint to avoid any possible ambiguity. This option has no
# default and must be set before the Nymserver will work.
#key = pgpkey_fingerprint

[domains]
# The domain name the Nymserver actually uses in outbound posts and email.
# This should almost certainly be one of the domains specified in 'hosted'.
#default = nymserv.net

# This is a comma-seperated list of all the domains the Nymserver plays host
# to.  Messages to any of these will be accepted by the server.
#hosted = nymserv.net,othernym.org

[hsub]
# Although a full hSub is 80 characters long, it make sense to blend in with
# the older, eSub format which is only 48 chars.  This should never be set
# below 48 or higher than 80.
#length = 48

[nntp]
# Refer to the NNTP specification for more detail.  This is the Path header
# the Nymserver will insert as the injecting news host. You certainly want to
# set it to something meaningful to your environment.
#path = nymserv.domain.org!not-for-mail

# Users of Usenet like to have somewhere to complain.  As this service should
# only ever post to alt.anonymous.messages, hopefully they will not need a
# contact address but you should still provide one.
#contact = abuse@domain.org

# The From header that will be inserted into messages posted to Usenet. I
# think noreply@ is a good start.  The domain should be your own.
#from = Nobody <noreply@domain.org>

# Injection-Info is a relatively new header to Usenet. We add it because doing
# so is easy.  It serves no purpose other than to identify the point of
# injection.
#injectinfo = nymserv.domain.org

# You would probably only change this for testing purposes.  The group
# alt.anonymous.messages has been the standard for Nym replies since, well,
# forever really.
#newsgroups = alt.anonymous.messages

[thresholds]
# Sometimes bad things occur and Nyms are flooded or worse, used to flood
# other people.  These thresholds define maximum limits of Nym activity before
# temporary blocks are put in place.

# The send threshold is probably the most important.  Incoming messages to a
# Nym might generate a load of traffic in alt.anonymous.messages but the
# chances are, nobody will notice.  An evil Nymholder using the service to
# flood an individual is not only unsociable but bad for the service image.
# When this limit is hit in a single day (midight - midnight UTC), sending
# for that Nym will be disabled.
#dailt_send_limit = 50
