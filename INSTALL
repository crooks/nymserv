The following command will install the nymserv program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files that will be installed.

Before using the Nymserver you'll need to generate it a PGP keypair.

Run the command:
gpg --homedir <your keyring path> --gen-key
Then follow the instructions to create the config@<nym_domain> account.
Note: <your_keyring_path> should match the .nymservrc keyring setting.

The key will then have to be edited to add uids for send@<nym_domain> and
url@<nym_domain>.  See http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN282 for
further details on this step.

Next, try starting nymserv with the --process option.  Although you have no
incoming mail for it at this point, it will create the directory structure and
check you have no errors.  If this goes well, configure your MTA to deliver
messages to the server and start it in Daemon mode.

That's it, you're done!
